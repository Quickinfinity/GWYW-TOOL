The psalmist prays, \u201cRemove from me the way of lying\u2026\u201d Not just the lie\u2014but the way of lying: the habits, the excuses, the compromises, the influences, the wrong desires, the subtle temptations. Proverbs 30:8 is the same prayer: \u201cRemove\u2026 vanity and lies.\u201d Agur understood that lies begin long before they are spoken\u2014they begin in the heart. The believer must not simply confess sin; he must ask God to destroy the path that leads to sin. Only God\u2019s Word, received \u201cgraciously,\u201d can purify the mind, correct the heart, and guard the tongue.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Jacob the Deceiver (Genesis 27).</strong> Jacob didn\u2019t just tell lies\u2014he walked the way of lying: manipulation, pretending, deceiving, covering, plotting. His path of lying damaged relationships, caused fear, and brought trouble. But when Jacob wrestled with God (Genesis 32:24\u201330), the Lord changed his name, his walk, his direction. God removed the way of lying, and made him Israel\u2014a prince with God. God changes the path before He changes the speech.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Peter\u2019s Denial (Luke 22:55\u201362).</strong> Peter also knew \u201cthe way of lying.\u201d He followed afar off (wrong distance), he warmed himself by the enemy\u2019s fire (wrong crowd), he feared man (wrong focus), then he denied the Lord (wrong words). But when the rooster crowed and Jesus looked at him, Peter wept bitterly. That moment was God removing the way of lying from Peter\u2019s life. After repentance, Peter was transformed: bold in Acts, truthful in preaching, steadfast in suffering, faithful until death. God removed the lying pathway and gave Peter strength to speak truth. God\u2019s people don\u2019t just need forgiveness from lies\u2014they need God to remove the way of lying. Only His Word and His grace can change the path and purify the heart.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

It shifts the heart from Christ to things, from trusting God to chasing gain, from contentment to restlessness. The psalmist prays, \u201cIncline my heart unto thy testimonies,\u201d because the only cure for a wandering heart is a Word-turned heart. And the Lord Jesus warns, \u201cBeware,\u201d because covetousness is subtle \u2014 it disguises itself as need, ambition, or opportunity. A life ruled by desire for \u201cmore\u201d forgets the true measure of life: not what we hold, but Who holds us. When God bends the heart toward His Word, He bends it away from covetousness, and the believer learns that Christ is enough.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Achan (Joshua 7:20\u201321).</strong> Achan saw a goodly Babylonish garment, silver, and gold and covetousness seized his heart. He confessed, \u201cI coveted them, and took them.\u201d His desire for forbidden gain brought defeat to Israel, shame to his family, and death to himself. His life proves the truth of Psalm 119:36 \u2014 when the heart is not inclined to God\u2019s Word, it is easily bent toward destruction.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The Rich Young Ruler (Mark 10:21\u201322).</strong> Jesus offered him treasure in heaven, but covetousness held him fast. Scripture says, \u201cHe went away grieved: for he had great possessions.\u201d He wanted eternal life, but he did not want to let go of the rival god in his heart. Christ\u2019s warning in Luke 12:15 becomes a living picture: abundance cannot satisfy a soul unwilling to follow Jesus. When the Word fills the heart, covetousness loses its power; but when covetousness rules the heart, it blinds us to the true riches found only in Christ.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"

Although Samuel\u2019s appearance was unique and exceptional, his message was clear: \u201cWherefore then dost thou ask of me, seeing the LORD is departed from thee?\u201d (1 Sam. 28:16). Saul wanted a word from God after the day of obedience had passed.

Judas, like the rich man in Luke 16, awakened beyond the grave to the consequences of sin and unbelief\u2014conscious, accountable, and outside of mercy.

In 1 John, hatred toward a brother is not merely a relational failure\u2014it is evidence of a heart walking in darkness. In Proverbs, wickedness is pictured as a path so dark that a man cannot even identify what causes his fall. When love is absent, light is absent; and when light is absent, direction is lost.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Darkness deceives. A person walking in it may feel confident, justified, or even religious, yet remains unaware of the very things causing repeated failure. Only the light of God\u2019s truth and love exposes the path and restores clarity.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Cain (Genesis 4:3\u20138).</strong> Cain\u2019s hatred toward his brother Abel blinded him. Though God warned him\u2014\u201csin lieth at the door\u201d\u2014Cain walked on in darkness. He did not see that his anger would lead to murder. Darkness hid the consequence until the moment he stumbled into irreversible sin. Hatred darkened his understanding and severed his fellowship with God.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>Judas Iscariot (John 13:21\u201330).</strong> Judas walked with Christ, heard His teaching, and witnessed His miracles\u2014yet his heart was darkened by covetousness and bitterness. When he left the upper room to betray the Lord, Scripture notes, \u201cand it was night.\u201d Judas did not know at what he stumbled until it was too late. Darkness blinded him, even while standing near the Light of the world.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Darkness is not merely the absence of knowledge\u2014it is the absence of love and truth ruling the heart. When believers harbor hatred, bitterness, or secret sin, the path grows dark and stumbling becomes inevitable. Walking in love is walking in light; and walking in light restores sight, direction, and fellowship with God.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->"
